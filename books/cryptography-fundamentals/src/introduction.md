# Introduction to Cryptography

Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversaries. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to both classical and modern cryptographic methods.

## What is Cryptography?

Cryptography involves creating mathematical algorithms and protocols that allow for:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access
- **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of communicating parties
- **Non-repudiation**: Preventing parties from denying they sent or received messages

## Historical Context

The history of cryptography spans thousands of years, from ancient techniques like the Caesar cipher used by Roman generals to modern quantum-resistant algorithms designed to protect against future quantum computers.

## Modern Applications

Today, cryptography is essential for:
- Online banking and e-commerce
- Secure messaging applications
- Blockchain and cryptocurrencies  
- Internet protocols (HTTPS, TLS)
- Mobile device security
- Cloud computing security

## About This Book

This book covers both theoretical foundations and practical implementations of cryptographic systems. Each chapter includes mathematical explanations, code examples, and real-world applications.

The content is organized from basic concepts to advanced topics, making it suitable for students, developers, and security professionals looking to deepen their understanding of cryptography.
