# Classical Cryptography

Classical cryptography refers to encryption methods that were developed before the advent of modern computers. These methods typically rely on simple mathematical operations and were often designed to be executed by hand or with mechanical devices.

## Characteristics of Classical Ciphers

Classical ciphers generally have the following characteristics:
- **Symmetric**: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption
- **Manual execution**: Could be performed without computers
- **Character-level operations**: Work on individual characters rather than bits
- **Pattern preservation**: Often preserve language patterns making them vulnerable to statistical analysis

## Historical Importance

While classical ciphers are no longer considered secure by modern standards, they provide important historical context and help us understand fundamental cryptographic concepts:

1. **Key management**: The challenge of securely distributing keys
2. **Frequency analysis**: How patterns in natural language can be exploited
3. **Cryptanalysis**: Methods for breaking encryption without the key

## Common Classical Cipher Types

### Substitution Ciphers
Replace each character in the plaintext with another character according to a fixed system:
- **Monoalphabetic**: Each plaintext character maps to exactly one ciphertext character
- **Polyalphabetic**: Different substitution rules are used for different positions

### Transposition Ciphers
Rearrange the characters of the plaintext according to a specific pattern without changing the actual characters.

## Educational Value

Studying classical ciphers helps understand:
- Basic cryptographic principles
- Common attack methods
- Evolution of cryptographic thinking
- Importance of key space and randomness

In the following chapters, we'll examine specific classical ciphers in detail, including their encryption/decryption processes and vulnerability analysis.
