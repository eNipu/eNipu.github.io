# Introduction to Secure Multi-Party Computation

Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is a subfield of cryptography that enables multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. This revolutionary concept allows organizations to collaborate on data analysis without revealing their sensitive information.

## The Privacy Paradox

In our data-driven world, we face a fundamental paradox:
- **Data utility**: More data leads to better insights, predictions, and services
- **Privacy requirements**: Legal, ethical, and business requirements demand data protection

Secure computation technologies bridge this gap by enabling "privacy-preserving computation" - the ability to compute on encrypted data without decrypting it.

## Key Concepts

### What is Secure Multi-Party Computation?

MPC allows multiple parties to compute a joint function f(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) where each party i holds a private input xᵢ. The computation reveals only the output of the function, not the individual inputs.

### Security Properties

A secure MPC protocol guarantees:
1. **Privacy**: No party learns anything beyond what can be inferred from the output
2. **Correctness**: The computed result is accurate
3. **Input independence**: Parties must choose inputs before learning others' inputs
4. **Guaranteed output delivery**: Honest parties receive the correct output

## Real-World Applications
