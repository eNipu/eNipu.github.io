## Checking SHA-256 Hash from terminal
Sometimes things get wrong when exchanging files.
The best way to check if the files coppied/transfered are same is using HASH check sum.

In MAC OS it can be done from terminal using the command

```bash
shasum -a 256 <file1 file2 ...>
```

## Checking checksum files
To check the if the receieved checksum is same use the following command
```bash
shasum -a 256 -c <checksum_file_name>
```

## Creating own checksum files
```bash
shasum -a 256 <file names> > <checksum_file_name>
```
