Brief of Carrer, Education, and Interest
- 2008: Enrolled in top tier Engineering school in Bangladesh to study Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
- 2008: Realized my passion for Computer Science. Changed the major to Computer Science and Engineering.
- 2012: Received the Bachelor's degree with the position in the top 7 percentile of the class.
- 2015: Worked 3.5 years as a Software Engineer to build a social intranet that is used by over a million users. Build interest in Cryptography during that time while doing R&D for the product.
- 2015: Received MEXT scholarship to study in Japan.
- 2015: Started Ph.D. research in cryptography focused on pairing-based cryptography at Okayama University, Japan.
- 2019: Received Ph.D. and interested to get practical work experience in Japan. Joined at a FinTech Startup in Tokyo. Thanks to Japan's interest to promote a cashless society.

■ Hello recruiter: Why you would like to hire me?
- I worked with an international team of Software Engineers and had a decent knowledge of development lifecycle like Scrum philosophy, Agile manifest.
- Skilled in writing nontrivial code in C and C++. Has working familiarity with Java, Python. Knowledge of Objective-C and iOS development is rusty now. Since worked about 5 years ago.
[Well many people seems to have the above skills these days]
- Decent working knowledge of GNU build systems i.e. Autotools and documentation tools like Doxygen, Latex, Pandoc.
- Have experience of working under extreme deadlines. Thanks to my doctoral course.
- Contributed to improve development cycle of the team by 10% by introducing tools that make code formatting easier and less time consuming and faster build time than before for existing large C++ code-base.
- Quick learner and a team player. I will add diversity to your team.
- If your team requires a very deep understanding of the cryptography tools to use for your product, hope my expertise will not disappoint you.

■ I found that I'm most happy when
- my research works have some practical impact.
- learning new things. Recently I build interests in privacy-preserving ML. I am trying to build my knowledge base.
- taking a challenge and completing it. Trying to master in one programming language. I figured out that I know several programming languages pretty well. But haven't mastered one yet. Trying to master the challenging and interesting programming language C++ with 10,000-hour rules.
- cooking new recipes.
- after hiking and seeing the world from the mountain-top.
