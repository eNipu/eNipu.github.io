The contents of the database are always encrypted and all queries are performed over encrypted data only. The encryption keys are stored separately from the database, and data is never decrypted at the database side. This is in contrast to current database solutions which partially decrypt the data when performing queries.\nNotable features of Gate DB: data is always-on encryption(during communication, at rest, during processing). The contents of the database are always encrypted and all queries are performed over encrypted data. The encryption keys are not stored in the database. It supports bring-your-own-key(BIOK) data is never decrypted at the database side which is different from traditional database systems. Key contributions: Implemented Homomorphic-encryption(HE) to perform ‚ÄòSQL aggregate functions‚Äô. Reduced the bulk insertion and encryption time by 5 times by eÔ¨Äicient implementation of HE algorithms and multi-processing in Rust. Implemented Lifted-ElGamal over prime field as Somewhat-Homomorphic-Encryption (using BLS-12 elliptic curve pairing) for Homomorphic addition of cipher-text. Improved the bulk data transmission using gRPC between client and the proxy.

This paper has presented a skew Frobenius mapping technique in the sub-field isomorphic sextic twisted curve of Kachisa-Schaefer-Scott (KSS) pairing friendly curve of embedding degree 18 in the context of Ate based pairing. Utilizing the skew Frobenius map along with multi-scalar multiplication procedure, an efficient scalar multiplication method for KSS curve is proposed in the paper. In addition to the theoretic proposal, this paper has also presented a comparative simulation of the proposed approach with plain binary method, sliding window method and non-adjacent form (NAF) for scalar multiplication. The simulation shows that the proposed method is about 60 times faster than plain implementation of other compared methods.","tags":["elliptic curve crypto"],"title":"An Improvement of Scalar Multiplication by Skew Frobenius Map with Multi-Scalar Multiplication for KSS Curve","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project was done based on Ph.D. works on elliptic-curve pairing.
